# assignment_scheduling_submision_system
project weekly deliverables
Planning and simulating a more complex assignment submission system with synthetic data, a contemporary database design, and machine learning-based conflict detection are the goals of this project. Among the goals are evaluation of the systems for submitting assignments and their shortcomings, using artificial academic data to create a relational data model, and putting in place an SQL database for efficient major operations.

Developing a machine learning algorithm to predict submission conflicts,
Submission trends and deadline overlaps are visualized for insights.
A thorough report complete with database files, code, visualizations, and accompanying documentation will be the end result.

Overview of the System
The suggested system for submitting assignments replicates a normal academic setting with lots of users, courses, assignments, and deadlines. The following elements make up the system:

Functionalities & Features:
Monitoring submissions with timestamp logging
Enforcing deadlines and establishing grace periods
Integration of early-stage machine learning conflict prediction
Features for visualizing high-risk due dates and submission obstacles

Overview of Workflow:
Professors assign assignments with due dates.
Through the system, students submit them.
The program detects late submissions and timestamps them.
Conflict detection recognizes when deadlines overlap.
Administrators resolve conflicts and view visual reports.
